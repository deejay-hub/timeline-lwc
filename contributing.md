# Contributing to Timeline

## General guidelines

The best thing about the trailblazer community is contributions. Timeline needs lots of help and will need people to contribute who have a diversity of skills. However, please ask yourself "should timeline do X?" as the answer is sometimes "no". **So ask first!** It might save you some time and energy.

#### Design principles

1.  Timeline can be used across industries, apps and objects. If a change is not generic don't add it
2.  Timeline is simple and intuitive to use. Less is more.
3.  Lightning base components will be used in preference to custom components.
4.  Timeline can be used in any language and locale. If you can't translate/localise it, don't add it.

#### Flow
